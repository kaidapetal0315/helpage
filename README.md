# Helpage
One-Stop solution for clumsy bookmarks. Helpage lets you organize your custom bookmarks and most visited sites onto a basic HTML5 webpage.

## User end
We have planned the project in such a way that on the user-end you can add your own icons, websites, favorites and articles to read.
A less tedious approach could be that you can set helpage as your browser's default startup page, so you won't have to go through a bunch of folders to look for it.
A search bar has also been provided after personally using helpage 1.0 for months.

### Note:
The project is under-construction. Some of the functionalities might be unavailable/ won't work.


## **How to use Helpage?** *(Efficiently!!)*
1. Copy the link ```https://devanshuyadav.github.io/Helpage/```
2. Set this as your browser/s startup page.
3. You're Good to Go. 

Now everytime you open your browser, you'll have all your selected websites at one place.
