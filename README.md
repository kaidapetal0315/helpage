# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**How to Personalize Helpage?**

1. Fork the Repository.

2. Clone the Repository to your Local Environment.

3. Once the Repository has been cloned you have to open it in Git bash.

4. Create a branch specific to the issue you are working on.
   ```shell
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
   For clarity, name
   your branch `update-xxx` or `fix-xxx`. The `xxx` is a short description of the changes you're making. Examples include `update-readme` or `fix-typo-on-contribution-md`.

5. Open up the project in your favorite text editor, select the file you want to contribute to, and make your changes.

6. Add your modified files to Git.
   ```shell
   git add path/to/filename.ext
   ```
   You can also add all unstaged files using:
   ```shell
   git add .
   ```

   **Note:** using a `git add .` will automatically add all files. You can do a `git status` to see your changes, but do it **before** `git add`.

7. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.
   ```shell
   git commit -m "Brief Description of Commit"
   ```

8. Verify that the origin is your own forked branch and not the main repository.
   ```shell
   git remote --verbose
   ```

9. Push your commits to your GitHub Fork:
   ```shell
   git push -u origin your-branch-name
   ```

10. Submit a pull request.
Within GitHub, visit this main repository and you should see a banner suggesting that you make a pull request. While you're writing up the pull request, you can add `Closes #XXX` in the message body where `#XXX` is the issue number you're fixing. Therefore, an example would be `Closes #42` would close issue `#42`.
