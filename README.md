# Helpage-2.1
One-Stop solution for clumsy bookmarks. Helpage lets you organise your custom bookmarks and most visited sites onto a basic html5 webpage.
## User end
We have planned the project in such a way that on the user-end you can add your own icons, websites, favourites and articles to read.
A less tedious approach could be that you can set helpage as your browser's default startup page, so you won't have to go through a bunch of folders to look for it.
A search bar has also been provided after personally using helpage 1.0 for months.

### Note:
the project is under-construction. Some of the functionalities might be unavailable/ won't work.
