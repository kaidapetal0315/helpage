### Adding New Icon to the Page

    - `LINK` to the Website you want to add.
    - An `IMAGE/SVG` for the Logo of the Concerned Website (or Any Relevant Reference Picture you want to have).
2. Upload the `IMAGE/SVG`, into `assets/` folder with an Appropriate Name *( let's call it ICON_1 for example )* and Extension *( **.png**, **.jpg**, **.jpeg**, **.svg** are some of the extension that'll work fine )*.
    - Your File should have a relative path similar to `assets/ICON_1.png` *(For Example)*.
3. Once you've gathered everything listed above and added the Logo
    - Open `Index.html` and find `<ADD ICON HERE>`. 
    - You'll have to decide where exactly you want to add your new icon in the page & find exactly **that particular** `<ADD ICON HERE>` comment.
4. Copy and Paste the following lines of code ***on the line JUST ABOVE*** the `<ADD ICON HERE>` Comment.

    ```
    <!-- <ADD ICON HERE> -->

    <!-- <INSERT NAME> -->

      <div class="col-sm-4 col-4 col-lg-2 col-md-3">
        <div class="icons dark-elem">
          <a href=" <ADD LINK HERE> " target="_blank">
            <img src="assets/<NAME OF IMAGE/SVG>" alt="<ALT TEXT>" height="100px">
          </a>
        </div>
      </div>
